            <li>Season the Brisket:</li>
            <li>Heat your smoker to a temperature between 225°F and 250°F.</li>
            <li>Once the internal temperature reaches 160°F-170°F and a good bark has formed, wrap the brisket tightly
                in heavy-duty aluminum foil or butcher paper.</li>
            <li>Return the wrapped brisket to the smoker and continue cooking until it reaches an internal temperature
                of 200°F to 205°F.</li>
            <li>Remove the brisket from the smoker and let it rest, still wrapped, for at least 1 hour, or preferably 2
                to 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Slice and eat!</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your smoker to 250°F. Use a heavier smoke wood (oak, mesquite, hickory, or pecan) or a pellet
                blend for the best flavor.</li>
            <li>Remove all excess fat from the pork butt.</li>
            <li>Cover the pork butt thoroughly in hot sauce. Liberally season all sides with Meat Church Dia de la
                Fajita Seasoning. Let it sit for at least 15 minutes so the seasoning adheres.</li>
            <li>Place the pork butt directly on the grate, fat side down. Smoke for about 7–8 hours (plan on about an
                hour per pound) until a good bark forms and the internal temperature reaches at least 170°F (about 5–6
                hours in).</li>
            <li>Remove the pork butt and place it in a half steam pan. Apply more hot sauce and seasoning, add sliced
                butter on top, and pour chicken stock in the bottom of the pan. Cover tightly with foil and return to
                the smoker.</li>
            <li>Continue cooking until the pork butt reaches 205°F internal temperature and is probe tender (no
                resistance when tested with an instant-read thermometer).</li>
            <li>Let the pork rest for at least 30 minutes. Optionally, separate the au jus with a fat separator for
                later use. Shred or pull the pork, sprinkle more seasoning, and toss with the au jus.</li>
            <li>Build tacos or sandwiches with the pulled pork and enjoy!</li>

        <h2>Bacon</h2>
        <img src="images/bacon.jpg" alt="A picture of bacon">
        <ol>
            <li>Start with a fresh, skinless pork belly.</li>
            <li>Mix together curing salt (such as Prague Powder #1), kosher salt, sugar, and optional seasonings (like
                black pepper, maple syrup, or brown sugar).</li>
            <li>Rub the cure mixture evenly all over the pork belly.</li>
            <li>Place the pork belly in a sealable bag or container and refrigerate for 7 days, flipping it every day to
                redistribute the cure.</li>
            <li>After curing, rinse the pork belly under cold water to remove excess cure. Pat it completely dry with
                paper towels.</li>
            <li>Place the pork belly, uncovered, on a rack in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight. This
                helps form a tacky surface (pellicle) for better smoke adhesion.</li>
            <li>Preheat your smoker to 175–200°F (80–95°C). Smoke the pork belly until it reaches an internal
                temperature of 150°F (65°C), usually 2–3 hours.</li>
            <li>Let the bacon cool, then refrigerate until firm for easy slicing.</li>
            <li>Slice the bacon to your desired thickness and cook as desired. Enjoy!</li>
