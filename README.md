Suggestion #1: Text color in nav menu needs to be more contrast, rather than a black on dark color background. Also suggest bolding the numbers in the recipe page to make it clearer. 

    FIX - I changed the text to use Google Font with Bold white on all HTML pages. 

Suggestion #2: Fix Creations page 2 page break. Fix visual imbalance between two columns on Smokers and Tools page. 

    FIX - I increased the max-width on my media queries. Specificall on page two I increased the max width to 1100px on the nav bar, and 780px on the main section. I fixed the two columns to be even to not show visual imbalance.
